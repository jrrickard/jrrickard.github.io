    <p>This week ended up being a little crazy and I haven&#39;t had enough time to really devote to writing up the Xenon vs Spring comparison, so I&#39;m going to break this up into more managable pieces. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t get into <a href="https://github.com/vmware/xenon">Xenon</a> fundamentals too much in this post, but in general you build capabilities using  cooperating REST services. Xenon lets you build REST services, but also provides a mechanism for persistence and replication of data as well as built in query capabilities. </p>

<p>In the Xenon world, services fall into two main types of services: stateful and stateless. At the heart of stateful services is something called a Plain Old Data Object, or a PODO. Under the covers, Xenon uses Lucene as a persistence mechanism and provides services on top of Lucene to handle replication to enable building distributed stateful services across many Xenon nodes. Within a stateful service, you implement logic to handle the persistence/management of a PODO. Stateful services can also be used to model Tasks, via <a href="https://github.com/vmware/xenon/wiki/Task-Service-Tutorial">Task Services</a>. Stateless services, on the other hand, do not represent some sort of state like a Stateful service. </p>

<p>Some important things to keep in mind with Xenon is that it isn&#39;t really intended to facilitate building things using normal object oriented design. It discourages inheritance and focuses on code-reuse through composition of stateless helper services or stateless utility classes. It also very highly discourages blocking operations. Working with within these constraints took some adjustment for me. When I first started implementing the Winter Series app, I made the mistake of emebedding logic into stateful services (base classes) and tried to share this into my services through inheritance. This didn&#39;t work that well in practice and also caused some issues with testing the code. Writing testable code when I violated the Xenon principles actually became pretty difficult and more or less forced me into writing code that I think fit a little better with the model. As an example, I had wrote some Task services that did some blocking calls to a client library that called an external service. Writing unit tests for the Task service was actually quite difficult because I could not Mock the service easily. This led me to refactor into a stateless utility class that I interacted with via a stateless helper service.  That was much easier to provide a mock implementation of, which I think led to more testable code. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at the building blocks of my Winter Series app, starting with a Participant. I need to be able to do CRUD operations of race participants, so we need a PODO and a Service object to deal with it. </p>

<p>First, the PODO:</p>

<p>As you can see, this is pretty simple. The AUTO<em>MERGE</em>IF<em>NOT</em>NULL enables me to write a little bit less logic in the service.</p>

<p>Now for the service:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kn">package</span> <span class="n">io</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">github</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">jrrickard</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ws</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">service</span><span class="o">;</span>

    <span class="o">}</span>

<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This simple service gives me the Create (via a POST operation to /ws/participants), Retrieve (via GET operation to /ws/participant/id), Update (via a PUT operation) and Delete (via a DELETE operation), inherited from the StatefulService class. The PUT operation will simpy replace the state with whatever is passed as the body of the PUT. If I want to change any of this behavior, I can just override any of the methods from the StatefulService class. </p>

<p>With the two above, I just need to build a Xenon ServiceHost. This is another pretty simple class:</p>

<p>Running this will start up the Participant factory service (POSTing to this will create new service instances -- one for each participant). I started this up by running the service host via the shaded jar produced by the Gradle build like so:</p>

<p>As you can see from the output, this started up on port 8000. You could run it without the sandbox argument, but I needed that because I&#39;ve run another service on this laptop and it clashed with the state in my service (more on that later). </p>

<p>I can then use a browser to examine the service :</p>

<p><img src="http://jrrickard.github.io/images/xenon/query-in-browser.png" alt="Query browser"> </p>

<p>Next, I&#39;ll use Postman to create a record</p>

<p><img src="http://jrrickard.github.io/images/xenon/xenon-post.png" alt="Postman create"></p>

<p>Now if I query again (using Postman again..)</p>

<p><img src="http://jrrickard.github.io/images/xenon/get-participants.png" alt="Postman GET"></p>

<p>What happened here, is that first we made a POST to the ParticipantService factory. The body of this was then turned into a ParticipantService instance, with the state represented by our Participant PODO. Xenon took care of creating this for me through the StatefulService base code. When I then issued the GET request to the /ws/participants endpoint, it did a query to find all ParticipantService instances. In this case, there is only one.</p>

<p>I can then issue a GET request to get that specific service.</p>

<p><img src="http://jrrickard.github.io/images/xenon/specific-record.png" alt="Postman GET Service instance"></p>

<p>This time, the request was handled by the default handleGet() method in StatefulService. Nice an easy to build a really simple CRUD service.
I could easily run this as a multi-node cluster now and the use of the options in the ParticipantService constructor would tell Xenon to take care of replication and owner selection for me. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a LOT of boiler plate code here and it was fairly simple to make this single object, but it is a simple case. In the next post, I&#39;ll show a more complicated example involving links between PODOs and collections, as well as building out the app a little more with an architeture that fits a little more with what we&#39;ve done on my project at work. </p>
