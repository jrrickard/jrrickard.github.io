In early January, the majority of the R&D team in my office was laid off in an effort to streamline products and development sites. This included my team and our product [vRealize Air Compliance](https://www.vmware.com/cloud-services/management/). Luckily, I found another position within the company and would be able to stay in Colorado. I'm not working remotely with team members in Palo Alto (California) and Herzliya (Israel). It's been a big change, to say the least. I kept my desk in the office, but I found myself working from home more and more. I finally decided to give up my desk and covert to a home office.


The transition has been pretty seemless since I've been working from home so much. I was able to bring a couple of monitors home with me and setup my standing desk so I essentially have the same setup as I had at the office!

The desk is made from my existing [IKEA Lack Side Tables](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60193736/), along with a new [LINNMON / ADILS](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S29932181/). I had to make a few adjustments, but it ended up being essentially the perfect height. My new [WASD Keyboard](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/) is a little bigger than the Apple keyboard I had been using, so most of the adjustment had to be done to the keyboard ledge. 

The room I decided to use as a home office is our "technology" room and already had a PC for my son to use, along with my wife's knitting and my turntable. Oddly enough, it's the only room in the house that wasn't wired with Cat6 when the house was built. My next project is either running ethernet to the room or upgrading the wireless in the house.
