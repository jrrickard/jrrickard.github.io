I'm going to be doing a [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) related tech talk at work at the end of July, so I'm building up a set of examples. Three days ago, I saw a [kickstarter campaign](http://bl.ocks.org/jrrickard/b997968320a7674ce49f) to "bring back" Reading Rainbow. As of today (9:51 PM MDT...05/30/2014), they've almost passed 3 million dollars. 

I was curious where the backers clustered (many small backers? even split?) so I did made a [quick bar chart](http://bl.ocks.org/jrrickard/b997968320a7674ce49f) of pledge amount vs backer count using D3.

As an update, I grabbed the data again and made a [Sankey diagram](http://bl.ocks.org/jrrickard/7675229d0437594663a6).
