While I was still at Lockheed, I  made the switch from a chair to a stability ball at work. I prefer it to the chair now and siat on it almost exclusively. I had seen a few people that have made standing desks out of books / etc and they all prefer them, so I did some reading and decided I wanted to convert my desk.

We made a quick trip to IKEA today to pick up some supplies to build a standing desk based on [this](http://theimaginaryzebra.blogspot.com/2012/10/my-diy-standing-deskthe-2231-ikea-hack.html). 


###A couple of differences:

* LACK tables are high gloss white, so they will work like a whiteboard

* I covered the shelf with a piece of [panel board](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Thrifty-White-32-sq-ft-Hardboard-Panel-Board-709106/202090193#.UTlkj3wjrMA) from home depot...which will also work like a whiteboard.


Everything fit pretty well and day one went well. When I decided to do this, I wasn't thinking about the fact that I'd be able to easily just glance over at Pikes Peak, but that was a pretty nice bonus. My feet were a little sore by the time I left, but I expected that (minimal shoes). I also felt really productive, although I'm not sure the desk is why. The whiteboard tables proved to be a fantastic idea as well. It's now been over a year since I changed over to standing all the time. I've also obviously changed companies (and desks). The height I drilled everything for was my desk at LM. My VMware desk is slightly shorter, so I ended up using a couple packs of post-it notes and a couple CDs to prop up my keyboard tray. Other than that, it works just the same. The whiteboard aspect of the desk is my absolute favorite part.
