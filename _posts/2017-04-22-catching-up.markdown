It's been almost 6 months since my last post! I'm still working on my Xenon vs Spring series, but life got in the way. First a few work trips popped up, then we had a baby! Now that we're past those initial months of newborn life, I'm back to finishing up my series on Xenon vs Spring. I'll take a look at a simple CRUD service using Spring Boot + Spring Data next. After that, we'll take a look at what a controller layer might look like in both.

At work, I've been focusing on Kubernetes lately, so I'll share some of what I've been doing there as well. We've been taking advantage of [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) to get some clusters up and running, but I've also been working on following the super awesome [Kubernetes The Hardway](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) guide that [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower) has put together. I've been using VMware tooling though, getting it up and running with vCenter and [VIC](https://github.com/vmware/vic). That has been pretty interesting, so I'll share a post about that too fairly soon.
