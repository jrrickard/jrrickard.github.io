Next Tuesday will mark my one year anniversary with VMware and I still love it as much as I did the first day. 

Some of the things I've done:

+ Went to RADIO
+ Got to see the amazing Palo Alto campus
+ Wrote a whole bunch of ExtJS code and submitted some ExtJS bugs
+ Wrote a bunch more Java
+ Wrote some python!
+ Gave a company wide (well, via WebEx) presentation on D3.js
+ Worked on vCOps a little
+ Build and managed a lab for the team with tiny Intel NUC boxes that gets a suprising amount of use (customer demos!)
+ Volunteered with a bunch of people from the office on a Waldo Canyon Burn Scar restoration project
+ And last, but not least, helped develop a [brand new Software-as-a-Service offering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Au0eec2hkU)

I'm excited to see what the next year holds. It doesn't feel like a year, so I was pretty surprised when I got an email from the [VMware Foundation](http://www.vmware.com/company/foundation) congratulating me and giving me my one year of service charitable giving gift!
