Around this time last year, I was neck deep in proposal writing. It was the second Command and Control Applications and Information Services Development (C2AD) task order that we wanted to win. In 2012, we submitted the first task order and won! It was a pretty stressful, but rewarding experience. May of 2013 was basically a repeat, but with higher expectations and a "must win" mentality. It also marked a turning point with my career at Lockheed Martin and around this time, I decided I'd look for a new job. I had become pretty unhappy with the type of work available and some changes in the structure of my business unit. 

I had lots of uncertainity. I had spent almost 10 years working for LM. Nearly a third of my life! Almost my entire adult life! What would I do? Where would I go? I wanted to stay in Colorado Springs, I wanted to work in a commercial setting, I wanted to work with people that were excited about what they did and most of all, I wanted to work for a company that I respected. I didn't think I'd be able to check off all those wants, but late last summer I left my job of 10 years...my security clearance...and the network and reputation I had built for myself and started working for VMware in October! When I was leaving, lots of people were shocked that there was an office in Colorado Springs (there is) and that development happens there (it does).

It's been a pretty crazy transition. The environment is totally different, almost like culture shock (for the better). The work is fun, my team is great and I am learning a lot. I even had the opportunity to go to our [internal R&D conference](http://cto.vmware.com/radio-a-different-kind-of-high-performance/ "RADIO") and present a bunch of [crazy projects](http://jaas.co/2014/04/15/blog_as_a_service/) with [Josh](http://jaas.co/). 

Since I've rebooted my career, I'm rebooting my blog. I'll use it to document fun things I learn. I'll use it to talk about VMware. I'll use it to talk about running and cycling. Most importantly, I'll use it.
